Integrate with cucumber framework so that gherkin syntax can be used to detail test scenarios. This has the advantage of making the tests easier to read by non-technical stakeholders. 
Start each test with a clean browser session. This will ensure that the state of a test does not interfere with any subsequent tests.
Add some reporting to integrate with deployment pipelines.
Use properties file to store site URL's to make maintenance easier. These can then be accessed within the tests.
